/*
Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that zum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist.

sumZero([-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3]) [-3,3]
sumZero([-4,-3,-2,0,1,2]) undefined
sumZero([-2,0,1,3]) undefined
sumZero([1,2,3]) undefined
